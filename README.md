## Background
The dataset we have chosen to work with is the Alcohol Use dataset, provided on the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm), and this data on Excessive Drinking (https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm). This dataset provides information on alcohol use, including age, type, and more. There are several use cases for this dataset, including public health, education in public schools, or general awareness. 

There are several issues that we can associate with excessive alcohol use. Excessive alcohol use is common and costly. It is also associated with an increased risk of injuries, chronic diseases such as liver and heart disease, several cancers, and poor pregnancy outcomes.

## Business Problem and Goals
The purpose of this project is to analyze the influences towards health problems, alcohol-induced deaths caused by excessive drinking, by visualizing the alcohol use in different age groups in the US, which may positively help to educate the public about alcohol use trends, to support advocacy efforts for alcohol policy reform, and to inform public health interventions or support healthcare providers in diagnosing and treating patients with alcohol use disorder. 

For this project, we will be developing a dashboard that allows users to explore the CDCâ€™s alcohol use with more detail, including features such as creating customized charts, generating maps that show regional data with alcohol consumption, or other infographic reports to show insights and key findings about alcohol use.
